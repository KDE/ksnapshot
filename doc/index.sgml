<sect>Introduction
<p>
KSnapshot is a simple applet for taking screenshots. It is capable of
capturing images of either the whole desktop or just a single window.
The images can then be saved in a variety of formats.

<sect>Using KSnapshot
<p>
<sect1>Starting KSnapshot
<p>
Currently you can start KSnapshot either by selecting it from the
'Graphics' menu of kpanel or by typing <tt>ksnapshot</tt> at the
command line. Kwm's mini command line (invoked with <bf>Alt-F2</bf>) is
useful for this.

<p>
When KSnapshot is first executed it captures an image of the desktop
before it display's it's window. If this is what you want, you
can simply enter a filename then press the '<bf/Save/' button.

<sect1>Taking a snapshot
<p>
Taking a snapshot is easy, just press the '<bf/Grab/' button and KSnapshot
will capture an image. A small preview of the captured image is shown
in the KSnapshot window and you can see the image at it's full size
if you left click on the preview image.

<sect1>Saving the image
<p>
You can save the image you've grabbed by entering a filename then
pressing the '<bf/Save/' button. You can set the filename without having to
remember long paths by pressing the '<bf/Browse/' button. You can specify
the format by selecting one from the list below the filename.

<sect1>Controlling what the snapshot will contain
<p>
You can control which parts of the screen will appear in the snapshot
using the check boxes in the '<bf/Options/' group. The options available are
as follows:
<descrip>
<tag>Auto Raise</tag>
If this box is checked then KSnapshot will bring the selected window
to the front of the desktop before grabbing the image. This option has
no effect if you are grabbing the whole desktop.
<p>
<tag>Hide KSnapshot window</tag>
If this box is checked then KSnapshot will hide itself as soon as you
press the 'Grab' button. It will remain hidden until the snapshot has
been taken.
<p>
<tag>Only grab the window containing the cursor</tag>
If this box is checked then KSnapshot will grab an image of the window
which the mouse cursor is currently pointing to, if it is not checked
the whole desktop is grabbed.
</descrip>

<sect>What's new?
<p>
<descrip>
<tag>Version 0.2.7</tag>
<itemize>
<item>Fixed the bug identified in version 0.2.6 (finally).
<item>Tested with Qt 1.40 and KDE 1.0.
</itemize>

<tag>Version 0.2.6</tag>
<itemize>
<item>Added postscript/encapsulated postscript support. This code was 
written by Sven Wiegand
<htmlurl url="mailto:SWiegand@tfh-berlin.de" name="&lt;SWiegand@tfh-berlin.de&gt;">
Thanks Sven!
<item>I've converted the postscript code to a QImageIO handler so any
other KDE applications that want to write images as PS or EPS can use it.

<item>Bugs
There is currently a reproducible bug that if you select the root
window in `Only grab a window' mode then ksnapshot exits. I *am* testing
for this, but it isn't working, if anyone can see what's wrong please let
me know. Grep the sources for THISISABUG to find the problem. This bug is
now fixed.
