</H3>

<P>Currently you can start KSnapshot either by selecting it from the
'Graphics' menu of kpanel or by typing <CODE>ksnapshot</CODE> at the
command line. Kwm's mini command line (invoked with <B>Alt-F2</B>) is
useful for this.
<P>
<P>When KSnapshot is first executed it captures an image of the desktop
before it display's it's window. If this is what you want, you
can simply enter a filename then press the '<B>Save</B>' button.

<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Taking a snapshot</A>
</H3>

<P>Taking a snapshot is easy, just press the '<B>Grab</B>' button and KSnapshot
will capture an image. A small preview of the captured image is shown
in the KSnapshot window and you can see the image at it's full size
if you left click on the preview image.

</H3>

<P>You can save the image you've grabbed by entering a filename then
pressing the '<B>Save</B>' button. You can set the filename without having to
remember long paths by pressing the '<B>Browse</B>' button. You can specify
the format by selecting one from the list below the filename.

</H3>

<P>You can control which parts of the screen will appear in the snapshot
using the check boxes in the '<B>Options</B>' group. The options available are
as follows:
<DL>
<DT><B>Auto Raise</B><DD><P>If this box is checked then KSnapshot will bring the selected window
to the front of the desktop before grabbing the image. This option has
no effect if you are grabbing the whole desktop.
<P>
<DT><B>Hide KSnapshot window</B><DD><P>If this box is checked then KSnapshot will hide itself as soon as you
press the 'Grab' button. It will remain hidden until the snapshot has
been taken.
<P>
<DT><B>Only grab the window containing the cursor</B><DD><P>If this box is checked then KSnapshot will grab an image of the window

the whole desktop is grabbed.
