		       KSnapshot Release Notes
		       =======================

KSnapshot is intended to be an easy to use program for making
screenshots. Ultimately I would like to see it bound to the 
"Print Screen" key, as the program takes a snapshot of the desktop on
startup (before it displays it window) this would provide a simple way
of making snapshots.

Currently Implemented features:

- Mini Preview image (click for full size)
- Adjustable time delay.
- Auto hides it's own windows when grabbing.
- Grabs desktop or specific windows
- Load and save to various formats
- EPS/PS output
- Auto increment filename

Todo:
- Grab regions
