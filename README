		       KSnapshot Release Notes
		       =======================

KSnapshot is intended to be an easy to use program for making
screenshots. I can be bound to the Print Screen" key, as the program
takes a snapshot of the desktop on startup (before it displays it
window), so it's a simple way of of making snapshots.

Currently Implemented features:

- Mini Preview image
- Adjustable time delay.
- Auto hides it own window when grabbing.
- Grabs desktop or specific windows
- Save to various formats
- Auto increment filename


The original KSnapshot was implemented by Richard Moore (rich@kde.org)
for KDE1. Shortly before KDE2 I rewrote most of it to bring it a bit
closer to KDE2' higher standards.

This version is still not good, but I wanted something that doesn't
break translations and is still comfortable to old ksnapshot users.

Use Pixie if you want more functionality.
